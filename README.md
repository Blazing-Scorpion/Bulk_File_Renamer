# Bulk_File_Renamer

This program has been coded to allow the user to rename all the files in the entered folder.


The only required package is "termcolor", which can be installed using "pip install termcolor" or "pip3 install termcolor".

The user need to provide the folder path, whose files are to renamed! The other input is going to be the Initial of every File.

Example:

If the folder contains the following files:

* Python.py
* PHP.txt
* Java.txt
* explorer.xml

If the entered Initial is "Programming Languages", then the filename after the completion of the process is going to be:

* Programming Languages.py
* Programming Language_1.txt
* Programming Language_2.txt
* Programming Language_3.xml

This program has been coded with an attractive User Interface to allow the user to use the program conveniently. 

For any suggesstion, bugs or improvements in the program, feel free to raise an issue or mail me at "BlAzInGScOrPiOn_06@protonmail.com"
